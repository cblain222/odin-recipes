    <h2>A neapolitan pizza</h2>

    <p>This simple recipe will make you wonder why you ever got takeout pizza.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>For the dough</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of plain flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons table salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>
        <li>Cooking spray or olive oil</li>
    <p>For the sauce</p>
        <li>1 can of San Marzano tomatoes</li>
    <p>For the toppings</p>
        <li>12 ounces of fresh mozzarela, torn into small chunks</li>
        <li>2 ounces of basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <p>Make the dough:</p>
        <li>Combine the flour, salt, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Mix to
            combine.</li>
        <li>Add water and mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on low speed for 10 minutes. The mixture should come together into a unified mass that barely sticks
            to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. If the dough is sticking, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to the
            mixer while it is running, until the mass barely sticks to the bowl. If the mixture is too dry, add water, 1
            tablespoon at a time, to the running mixer.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 72 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to make the pizza, transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Divide the pizza dough into 4 even
            sections.</li>
        <li>Coat 4 small containers or bowls with nonstick cooking spray or olive oil.</li>
        <li>With floured hands, form each section into a ball.</li>
        <li>Place 1 dough ball into each coated container or bowl. Lightly spray the top of each dough ball with nonstick
            cooking spray or coat with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cover each container or bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Each dough
            ball should double in volume.</li>
      
        <p>Make the sauce</p>
            <li>Make the sauce by either pushing the tomatoes through a food mill or simply pulsing them in a food processor until a
                chunky liquid is formed.</li>

        <p>Assemble the pizza</p>
            <li>Heat the oven to at least 475 F, higher if your oven allows. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat as
                well.</li>
            <li>Onto a well-floured surface, stretch out each ball of dough into a 10-inch circle. Use a floured rolling pin if you
                need to. Donâ€™t worry about the dough being a perfect circle.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour a pizza peel making sure to cover where the dough will sit. Place one rolled-out piece of dough onto
                the peel and shake gently to ensure that the dough is not sticking.</li>
            <li>Spread about 1/3 cup of sauce over the dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch of the edge bare.</li>
            <li>Top the sauce with 1/4 of the mozzarella slices. Tear a few basil leaves and place them on top (according to your
                liking), and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. You can also add the basil and olive oil after the pizza is
                cooked.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pizza from the peel to the hot stone by gently shaking the peel back and forth until the pizza slides
                completely onto the stone.</li>
            <li>Bake about 5 to 7 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is charred in places.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining dough balls and ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
